# Visual Clock using P5js

Made a visual clock using P5js. The main time-story being the white ellipse representing the space ship orbiting in the solar system.
After every 4th minute, one astronaut appears, the astronaut being represented in the form of a red sphere. So after every 4th minute astronauts appear till 15 astronauts fill the screen maing it an hour.
Hence at the end of an hour, the color of the first big sphere, representing the sun will turn yellow.

To execute:-
Run the file named index.html which will run the script "sketch.js"


About P5js:-
p5.js is a JavaScript library that starts with the original goal of Processing, to make coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners, and reinterprets this for today's web.
Using the original metaphor of a software sketchbook, p5.js has a full set of drawing functionality. 
However, you're not limited to your drawing canvas, you can think of your whole browser page as your sketch! 
For this, p5.js has addon libraries that make it easy to interact with other HTML5 objects, including text, input, video, webcam, and sound.
